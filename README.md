The InterPlanetary Sync System or IPSS is a tool which allows users to store and sync their files in nearby nodes connected to the IPFS Network. 

## How does it work?

**IPSS** will run background as a daemon on your personal computer and keep track of every change you make to your file system on supported folders, it will upload every new version of your files and folders to nearby nodes connected to the IPFS network and keep them up to date, you will be able to access them anywhere. Even if you delete a file, our version control tool will help you find past versions of your files and recover them. Everything you upload will always be available to you.
