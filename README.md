The InterPlanetary Replication System or IPRS is a tool that allows users to store and sync their files in nearby nodes connected to the IPFS Network. 


## How does it work?

**IPRS** will run in the background in your personal computer and keep track of every change you make to your file system, then upload every new version of your files and folders to nearby nodes connected to the IPFS network and keep them up to date, you will be able to access them anywhere. Everything you upload will always be available to you.
